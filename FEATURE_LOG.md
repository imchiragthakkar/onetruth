## 🔬 Scientific Vedanta Content Strategy (No-God/Secular)
- [ ] **Secular Gita Interpretations**: Interpret Bhagavad Gita verses purely through psychology/neuroscience (e.g., "Field" = Consciousness, "Knower" = Awareness), avoiding all religious terminology.
- [ ] **Upanishadic Logic Modules**: Present concepts like 'Tat Twam Asi' as cognitive science principles (Interconnectedness of Systems) rather than spiritual dogma.
- [ ] **Mahabharata Case Studies**: Analyze characters as behavioral psychology case studies (Game Theory, Ethics, Duty) without divine attribution.
- [ ] **Neutral Language Audit**: Ensure all content uses scientific terms (Energy, Consciousness, Causal Laws) instead of religious ones (God, Heaven, Sin).

## 🤖 AI Integration & Feedback Architecture
- [ ] **AI Content Refinement**: System for AI to rewrite traditional texts into modern, scientific language before display.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: "Was this scientific/practical?" feedback mechanism on every wisdom card to train the underlying model.
- [ ] **Open API Structure**: Architect backend to easily plug in specialized AI models for real-time wisdom generation.
